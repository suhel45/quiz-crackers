        <p>Perpas of React Router?</p>
        <p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among 
        views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and 
        keeps the UI in sync with the URL.</p>

          <p>How does context Api work?</p>
          <p>The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.</p>
